    <!-- 
        Block elements block the entry of other elements.e.g:<p>,<h1>..<h6>,<div>.Even on changing its width,it still remains block element only,to change it,change display property. 
        If we wnat to change width of some <p> tag or any block element and also make it inline,then we need to make it inline-block.
        Inline elements take only that much space as much is needed.e.g:<span>,<img>,<a>
        Display:none removes element completely from our website,but it still remains in code.This is useful when we wish to hide ansers in quiz for some time.Other way to do this is visibilty:hidden.
        Differnce between display:none and visiblility:hidden is that visibility hidden only hides it ,but leave some space for that element to show that something exist there,but display:none donot leave any space for that element.

         Positions:
        By default,position is static.
        If we give it a relative position,then it will work only with corner properties such as top,bottom,left and right.
